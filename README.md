# WebbPSF Tutorials

![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/spacetelescope/webbpsf-tutorials)

WebbPSF is a point-spread function (PSF) simulator for the JWST instruments and the WFIRST Wide-Field Instrument in the spirit of TinyTIM for Hubble.

This repository contains Jupyter (IPython) notebook tutorials showing example calculations. It is also configured for use with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

## How to use

To run these examples in the cloud, use the ![Launch with Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/spacetelescope/webbpsf-tutorials) button. This will create a temporary workspace in Binder's cloud for you to run the code and experiment. **Note:** The temporary nature of the environment means it may be removed after use, so download any plots or files you create when you are finished.

To run these examples locally, install WebbPSF according to the instructions in the documentation. Then clone the repository to your computer:

    git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/webbpsf-tutorials

Finally, `cd webbpsf-tutorials` and start the Jupyter notebook:

    jupyter notebook

In the browser window that opens, you will see the list of tutorial notebooks.

## Questions?

This is an experimental product of STScI. The third-party Binder service in particular may not be online at all times, which is sadly beyond our control.

You can submit bug reports through the [WebbPSF issue tracker](https://github.com/mperrin/webbpsf/issues). For general JWST inquiries, you may use the [JWST help desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/jwst). (Log in with your MyST account at the upper right, or request a MyST account.)
